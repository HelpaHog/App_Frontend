  "description": "The Agriculture Building, built in 1927, was constructed in tandem with the Engineering Building on the southeast corner of campus, after the Arkansas Legislature passed a bill that appropriated $650,000 for their construction. This was, in actuality, a loan from the state since the $650,000 had to be paid back out of University operating funds at the rate of $50,000 per year. Nonetheless, this was a victory for the University because it had been 20 years since the state had appropriated any funds for buildings on campus.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The Agriculture and Engineering buildings were the first part of the ambitious campus plan designed by the architectural firm of Jamieson and Spearl of St. Louis in 1925, known as the \"100-year plan.\" Although the two buildings followed the master plan closely in location, they had to be scaled back and altered somewhat. The buildings, both in Collegiate Gothic architectural style, were designed by the Jamieson and Spearl firm along with H. Ray Burkes of Little Rock.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;This three-story building was constructed of reinforced concrete, surrounded by outer walls of Batesville white limestone in a variegated design. The compound Gothic central entrance tower dominates the south view and there is a three-dimensional University of Arkansas seal above the central lancet window between the towers. This was the first use of the seal on a University building after the seal\u0026amp;rsquo;s adoption by the Board of Trustees in 1923.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Dean of Agriculture Dan T. Gray called the new Agriculture Building \"As good a main building for teaching agriculture, equipped as perfectly for our work, as any in America today.\"\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Dr. W.M. Jardine, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, gave the main dedicatory address for the new building on June 6, 1927. Part of the dedication ceremony was the depositing of items in the building\u0026amp;rsquo;s cornerstone, located just to the east of the south entrance with the date \"1926\" inscribed.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Occupying the Agriculture Building initially were the departments of agronomy, horticulture, plant pathology, rural economics and sociology, and entomology; an agriculture library; an editor\u0026amp;rsquo;s office; and the agriculture dean\u0026amp;rsquo;s offices.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;In 1978, the departments of agronomy, horticulture and plant pathology moved into the new Plant Pathology building to the northeast. Both buildings are connected by an upper-level skywalk.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;During the early 1990s, the building underwent some changes to its mechanical systems and air conditioning, and the original windows were replaced by energy-saving fixed windows.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;In 2001, the dean\u0026amp;rsquo;s offices were moved from the Agriculture Building to the recently completed addition to the Agriculture, Food, and Life Sciences Building to the northwest, across Maple Street. Remaining in the Agricultural Building were agricultural business and economics, agricultural and extension education, agricultural communications, and entomology.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The Agriculture Building was accepted for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in September of 1992.",

  "description": "Ella Carnall Hall, built as a women\u0026amp;rsquo;s dormitory in 1906, was one of six new buildings on the campus completed that year.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The building is named for Miss Ella Harrison Carnall, associate professor of English and modern languages at the University from 1891-94. She had been a teacher in the University\u0026amp;rsquo;s Preparatory Department from 1881-84. She died in Fort Smith on March 30, 1894. Because of her excellence as a student and her later success as a teacher and role model for young women, the building was named in her memory.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;All six buildings finished in 1906 were funded in 1905 by the Arkansas Legislature, which appropriated $90,000 for their construction. Ella Carnall Hall was by far the most costly of the six, with $35,000 appropriated for its construction. Colonial Revival in its design influence and detailing, Carnall Hall also incorporates Victorian architectural design, a typical fusing of styles by the architectural firm C.L. Thompson and O.L. Gates of Little Rock.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Carnall Hall was a priority for the campus. There had been no dormitory for young women while two new ones had been built for young men\u0026amp;ndash;Buchanan Hall and Hill Hall, neither of which remains today. Carnall Hall was designed to be an island unto itself, with its own kitchen, dining room, toilets and bathrooms, and an independent steam heating plant.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The placement of Carnall Hall on the extreme Northeast corner of campus was no accident. It was put the farthest possible distance from the men\u0026amp;rsquo;s dorms. The strict separation of the sexes on college campuses was standard practice until the last third of the 20th century.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Carnall Hall was no longer used for a women\u0026amp;rsquo;s dormitory after 1967, by which time more modern residence halls had been built. In 1969, Phi Gamma Delta fraternity began using Carnall Hall as its fraternity house, remaining until 1977. The anthropology and geography departments also moved in during the early 1970s, and the sociology department joined them in 1979.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Ella Carnall Hall was accepted for listing the National Register of Historic Places in December 1982.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Carnall Hall ceased being used for academic purposes in 1991, when the restoration of Old Main created more space for academic departments. A chain link fence was placed around the unused building. Carnall Hall continued to deteriorate and by the late 1990s had become a candidate for demolition.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Ella Carnall Hall took on new life on October 2, 2001, however, when the University\u0026amp;rsquo;s Board of Trustees approved a plan for a private developer, Carnall Inn Development Co. LLC, to turn the structure into an historic hotel and restaurant at a cost of $6.9 million. James Lambeth was the lead architect for the project, with May Construction Co. as the contractor.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;",

The first was constructed in 1906, just north of Old Main, but became too small and outmoded for the sciences. A newer science building was considered earlier and was part of the master plan drawn up in 1925. It was one of the buildings recommended by a committee of the Arkansas Legislature in 1927 and was part of a building program approved by the Legislature in 1931, but the Great Depression caused further funding delays. When it became apparent that the state was not going to issue construction bonds, the University administration turned to the federal government.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p class=\"p1\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\"s1\"\u0026gt;The architectural firm of Wittenberg \u0026amp;amp; Delony of Little Rock, along with L.L.

Jamieson and Spearl of St. Louis, designers of the 1925 campus plan, served as consulting architects. Funding was made available in January 1934 when it was announced that loans and grants of $1,165,000 were coming from the PWA for the construction of the new Chemistry Building and a new, separate library building (Vol Walker Library). As it turned out, none of the construction money was supplied by the Arkansas Legislature, but the state was obligated to fund the debt service, insurance, and maintenance of these buildings. These were the first of several University buildings to be funded through the PWA during the 1930s and early 1940s.\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p class=\"p1\"\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\"s1\"\u0026gt;Construction bids were opened May 28, 1934, and the contract was awarded to Manhattan Construction Co. of Muskogee, Okla., with additional contracts beings awarded for infrastructure needs.

  "description": "The Chi Omega was the first Greek organization to build its own chapter house on the University of Arkansas campus. Chi Omega (Psi chapter) purchased this lot in the Oakland Place Addition in 1928. Construction began that same year and the new home was occupied in late 1928.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Psi Chapter is the mother chapter of the Chi Omega national organization. It was founded in Fayetteville on April 5, 1895, by Jobelle Holcombe, Ina Mae Boles, Jean Vincenheller, Alice Simonds, and Dr. Charles Richardson. All were University of Arkansas students except Dr. Richardson, who was a Fayetteville dentist interested in student life. He had assisted the four students to such an extent in getting the new sorority started that he was made an honorary member. More than 100 years after its founding, Chi Omega is the largest women\u0026amp;rsquo;s Greek organization in America, with 175 chapters in 42 states.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The Chi Omega House is a three-story building, plus basement, with Colonial Revival and Classical Revival influences. The original building was made to accommodate 45 young women, a house mother, a guest room, and a house manager\u0026amp;ndash;in addition to a chapter room, living room, dining room, kitchen, reception room, and laundry.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Plans for the original part of the house were prepared by Charles L. Ellis, the former superintendent of buildings and grounds at the University. Construction was by the Wages Brothers, contractors from Fayetteville, working in conjunction with James Dinwiddie, the city\u0026amp;rsquo;s building inspector and architect.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;When construction began in 1928, Miss Jobelle Holcombe, a charter member of Chi Omega, and at that time an associate professor of English at the University, turned over the first shovel of dirt. Total investment in the house was $35,000. These funds came from fees assessed for a \"house fund,\" benefit parties, friends, and bank loans. The gift that started the house fund was a $2,000 bequest from Dr. Richardson.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Growth of both the University and the Psi Chapter made it necessary to enlarge and remodel the house several times. In 1941 an addition was built on the west side. Architects were Edwin C. Price of Fayetteville, and Haralson and Nelson of Fort Smith. The contractor was the E.F.

  "description": "Chi Omega Greek Theatre was completed in the summer of 1930. This outdoor theater was part of the ambitious campus plan designed by the architectural firm of Jamieson and Spearl of St. Louis in 1925. Plans for the theater were completed by Jamieson and Spearl and this structure became the only portion of that master plan followed in both location and design. The idea for the theater and its site were conceived many years earlier by Mary Love and Dr. Charles Richardson, one of the Chi Omega founders, and this information was evidently passed on to the architects.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The manner of funding this facility, from the national Chi Omega sorority, was unique. It marked the first time in the history of Greek letter social organizations that a national sorority had presented a memorial of its foundation to the institution where it was founded. Chi Omega was organized on April 5, 1895, at the University of Arkansas and is the mother (Psi) chapter of the national organization.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The construction contract was awarded in February 1930 to the Young-Bryan Construction Co. of Fort Smith, Ark., on a bid of $31,225. Seating 2,750, the theater is modeled after on the 2,400-year-old Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, Greece.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Five large stones in the face of the stage carry the names of the founders of Chi Omega\u0026amp;ndash;Simonds, Boles, Richardson, Holcombe, and Vincenheller.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Members of the national sorority from across the nation gathered for the dedication of the theater on June 28, 1930. Principal speaker was U.S. Senator Joe T. Robinson of Arkansas. Mrs. Ida Pace Pardue, an early member of Chi Omega, made the formal presentation of the theater to the University, and President John C. Futrall accepted the gift. A pageant, \"The Earth Mother,\" was presented before the dedication.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Since then, the theater has been used for commencements, convocations, concerts, dramas, and pep rallies. The largest crowd ever assembled here\u0026amp;ndash;upwards of 6,000, according to professor Walter J. Lemke\u0026amp;ndash;was for a concert by the Army Air Corps Band during World War II.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;From 1934 to 1991, the space under the stage was used for a rifle range by the Army ROTC.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;In 1977 Chi Omega and the University entered into an agreement in which both parties are to share in the maintenance and renovation of the theater. On two previous occasions, Chi Omega paid for all of the renovations. A rededication of the theater was held June 23, 1980, on the 50th anniversary of its completion. Restoration work was completed just prior to that for which Chi Omega contributed $35,000. In 1995, extensive maintenance and renovation were completed at a cost of $186,250, shared by both Chi Omega and the University of Arkansas.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The Chi Omega Greek Theatre was accepted for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in September 1992.",

  "description": "The Home Economics Building, which now houses the School of Human Environmental Sciences, was completed in early 1940.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Two buildings had been completed in 1935\u0026amp;ndash;Vol Walker Library and the Chemistry Building\u0026amp;ndash;using loans and grants from the federal government\u0026amp;rsquo;s Public Works Administration (PWA). When construction started on December 28, 1938, the Home Economics Building was one of three more buildings funded by the PWA with a loan of $413,000 and a grant of $337,909 from the federal government. The other two buildings were the Student Union (now known as Memorial Hall) and the Classroom Building (the first phase of what is now Ozark Hall).\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The Manhattan Construction Co. of Muskogee, Okla., was the general contractor for the Student Union and Home Economics buildings at a bid of $405,600. Mechanical and electrical contracts added another $73,280. The architects for these two buildings were Haralson \u0026amp;amp; Mott of Fort Smith and Mann \u0026amp;amp; Wanger of Little Rock.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The Home Economics Building is a stone masonry edifice of Indiana white limestone and ashlar of Batesville limestone. It is two stories, plus basement. The building is of Collegiate Gothic architectural design, matching its companion structure to the east, the Agriculture Building. Previously, tennis courts were located where this building now stands.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The Home Economics Building was first occupied during final examination week in January 1940 when the department moved its offices, classrooms, and laboratories out of the old Home Economics Building\u0026amp;ndash;the first agriculture building (now the Agriculture Annex) located just north of the current Agriculture Building. The new food and textile laboratories were of the latest design. Faculty also were concerned with preparing teachers of home economics with a variety of home appliances. For example, the lab provided cook stoves that were fueled with either wood, kerosene, gas, or electricity, so students could become familiar with all four cooking media. Also located in the building were a child study laboratory, the bacteriology department, and offices for extension workers.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;During the 1990s the building underwent changes to its mechanical and air conditioning systems. The original windows were replaced by energy-saving fixed windows. These changes were completed by March 1992.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;In 1995, the Department of Home Economics became the new School of Human Environmental Sciences. The building\u0026amp;rsquo;s original purpose, however, is still marked by the words \"Home Economics\" carved in stone over the building\u0026amp;rsquo;s entrance.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The Home Economics Building was accepted for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in September 1992.",

  "description": "Old Main, the oldest building on campus, is the \"mother\" of all the other buildings of the University of Arkansas. Initially it was called \"the University building.\" In 1895, it was given a name that lasted the longest\u0026amp;ndash;University Hall\u0026amp;ndash;although for many years thereafter it was affectionately called \"Old Main.\" The Board of Trustees corrected this in 1991 when, after a major renovation, it officially changed the name to Old Main.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Old Main is a survivor. It withstood major fires in October 1905, August 1919, and October 1940. It was the first Fayetteville structure to be entered in the National Register of Historic Places in June 1970 and among the first in Arkansas to be so designated.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;After Arkansas Industrial University began classes in January 1872 in hastily built frame buildings, the University\u0026amp;rsquo;s Board made plans to construct a permanent, substantial building. These plans were delayed by the failure of the federal government to issue land scrip (whereby land-grant colleges were funded). In April 1873, the land-scrip income was finally received and invested in Fayetteville and Washington County bonds, thus making $121,333 available for building purposes. The structure was based on plans that architect John M. Van Osdel of Chicago had drawn for the main building at the Illinois Industrial University. On July 4, 1873, the low bid of $123,855 of Mayes and Oliver of Fayetteville was accepted.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The architectural style is Second Empire, with a Mansard roof forming the top story. The south tower has a concave silhouette, while the north tower has an ogee silhouette. On all four sides of the south tower are large round areas designed to be clock faces. These towers were reversed from the Illinois plan so that the \"clock tower\" could be closer to the city of Fayetteville for better viewing. No clocks were ever installed, however.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The building was ready for occupancy by September 1875. Left unfinished, however, were the fourth and fifth floors and part of the basement. The top two floors were completed in 1879 and 1882.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Despite regular maintenance, by the 1960s Old Main was rapidly deteriorating. What fire had not done, weather, rot, moisture, and termites were doing in earnest. In 1971, the Fort Smith firm of Mott, Mobley, McGowan \u0026amp;amp; Griffin was hired to renovate and rehabilitate Old Main, a process that took 20 years. The exterior of the building underwent stabilization and repair, but funding delays forced its evacuation.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;In 1985, the Arkansas Legislature appropriated $4 million if the University could raise the remainder. Under Chancellor Dan Ferritor, a fund raising campaign, \"Bring Old Main Back to Life,\" generated $6 million in two years. A comprehensive renovation began in 1989 and was completed by the spring of 1991, restoring the building to full elegance and beauty. At that time, Old Main was rededicated and given over to the J. William Fulbright College of Arts \u0026amp;amp; Sciences.",

  "description": "Memorial Hall was completed in early 1940, representing two distinct architectural styles. The front of the building is of Collegiate Gothic design while the remainder of the structure is modified Gothic and Classical Revival. The building is of stone masonry construction with Indiana white limestone and ashlar of Batesville limestone. The interior of the entrance and lobby are examples of Art Deco design.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Memorial Hall lived the first part of its life under the name \"Student Union.\" It was the first structure on campus built expressly for that purpose. A student union building had been sought for many years. Funding for the University\u0026amp;rsquo;s portion of the costs was made possible when President John C. Futrall came up with a plan in May 1938 to charge students a student union fee of $2 per year, plus an annual operating fee. The student body approved the plan, making loans and grants from the Public Works Administration (PWA) possible.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;When construction started on December 28, 1938, the Student Union was one of three buildings funded by the PWA with a loan of $413,000 and a grant of $337,909 from the federal government. The other two buildings were the Home Economics Building and the Classroom Building (the first phase of what is now Ozark Hall).\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;On September 12, 1939, when the Student Union was nearing completion, President Futrall was killed in an automobile accident. The Board of Trustees adopted a resolution on September 18 that the new student union be named Futrall Memorial Hall. The building continued to be called the Student Union, however.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The opening celebration for the Student Union took place on March 2, 1940, at the \"Reunion in the Union.\" On the ground floor were a recreational room, bookstore, post office, and a kitchen with a large snack area known as a confectionery. On the main floor were a main lounge, union offices, a checkroom, and a large two-story ballroom with an orchestra shell. The second floor had a game room and offices for student publications and student government. This building gave the campus a new focal point that student and alumni would converge upon for the next thirty-three years.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;In 1950, the building underwent a three-story addition on the east end and a one-story addition of the south side to increase food service facilities and other services. After the Arkansas Union (a newer student union) was built in 1973, revisions were made in 1976-77 which created classrooms, offices, and laboratories for the psychology department and the psychological clinic. Revisions in 1986 made two floors out of the ballroom, the bottom floor housing landscape architecture and the top floor housing Air Force ROTC.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;After student union functions moved to the Arkansas Union in 1973, the Board of Trustees changed the name of this building to Memorial Hall. In 1992, the building was accepted for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.",

  "description": "The first phase of this building was completed in 1940 and was known simply as the Classroom Building.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;When construction started on December 28, 1935, the Classroom Building was one of three buildings funded by the Public Works Administrations with a loan of $413,000 and a grant of $337,909 from the federal government. The other two buildings were the Home Economics Building and the Student Union, now known as Memorial Hall.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Manhattan Construction Co. of Muskogee, Okla., was the general contractor. Haralson \u0026amp;amp; Mott of Fort Smith and Mann \u0026amp;amp; Wanger of Little Rock were the architects. A stone masonry building of Indiana white limestone, the Classroom Building is similar in design to six other campus buildings erected between 1927 and 1937.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Moving into the Classroom Building in January 1940 were some business administration faculty, some mathematics faculty, and the department of buildings and grounds.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The next phase of what is now Ozark Hall began in summer 1946 and was finished in fall 1947, at a cost of $379,952. This addition was located on the east. It served to connect the Classroom Building on the north to the Commerce Building on the south. When the addition was complete, the building took on a \"U\" shape.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The exterior of the second phase matched the first phase very well in design and stone work. The interior floors of the two phases also matched perfectly. Several challenges faced the builders of this connecting phase, however. One was that part of the foundation could be placed on solid rock while other parts required driving concrete piles\u0026amp;ndash;some as deep as 30 feet. Another problem was that the Classroom Building on the north and the Commerce Building on the south were not exactly parallel.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;When this second phase was complete, the resulting structure including the Commerce Building was named the Business Administration Building. The remainder of the College of Business Administration, which had occupied the Commerce Building, moved into the newer part of the building. Finding some place in the entire structure were the departments of mathematics, history, political science, and military science, along with some buildings and grounds office space.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The College of Business Administration moved out of this building into a new Business Building on Ozark Avenue in 1978, and this structure was renamed Ozark Hall. It now houses the administrative offices of The Graduate School and various science departments and centers.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;In 1987, the old Commerce Building part of Ozark Hall was razed, leaving an unfinished west end of the south wing where it had butted against the older building. This was finished with white limestone to match the other building walls.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Ozark Hall was accepted for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in September 1992 under the name \"Business Administration Building.\" The name \"Business Administration\" still appears over the east entrance to Ozark Hall.",

  "description": "Vol Walker Hall, completed in 1935 as the new University library, was hailed by University President John C. Futrall (1913-39) as \"the most beautiful building in Arkansas.\"\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Funding became available in January 1934, with loans and grants of $1,165,000 coming from the federal Public Works Administration (PWA) for the construction of the library and a science building (later named the Chemistry Building).\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;In March 1931, the architectural firm of Haralson and Nelson of Fort Smith, along with the consulting architects of Jamieson and Spearl of St. Louis, were employed to design the new library. President Futrall, Mr. Haralson, and others visited several new library buildings and selected one at the University of Rochester to generally follow in design. An agreement could not be reached between the architects and consulting architects about the exterior, however. At his own expense, President Futrall employed Gordon and Kaehler, architects for the Rochester library, to make drawings for the front elevation. This resulted in the Georgian (Colonial) front on this Classical Revival building that lives in harmony with the Collegiate Gothic of other nearby buildings.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;At a Board of Trustees meeting on March 22, 1934, the new library was named the Vol Walker Memorial Library, in memory of James Volney \"Vol\" Walker who died December 20, 1933. Walker was an 1877 graduate of the University, a well-respected lawyer in Fayetteville, and a former member of the Arkansas Legislature. As a legislator, he successfully championed the cause to keep his Alma Mater in Fayetteville when the \"removal\" forces were working hard to move all or part of it to other locales.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;First occupying the building on September 16, 1935, was the library, with offices of the president of the University in the southwest corner of the main level and the museum in the front wing of the basement. In 1950, a west outside entrance was made from the northwest hall of the main floor. In 1952, the museum moved from the basement of Vol Walker back to the fourth floor of Old Main.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;When Mullins Library was completed in 1968 and the library moved there, the School of Architecture occupied the former library space in Vol Walker, except for the museum which began using the six-tiered stack area for storage. The name of the building was then changed to Vol Walker Hall. A year later, the offices of the president and other administrators were moved to the new Administration Building, and the dean\u0026amp;rsquo;s offices of the College of Arts and Sciences were moved in. When the last renovation of Old Main was completed in 1991, the dean\u0026amp;rsquo;s offices moved to Old Main and Vol Walker was occupied only by architecture and for museum storage. The museum moved from the stack area of Vol Walker in summer 2001.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Vol Walker Hall was accepted for listing in the National Register of Historic Places in September 1992 under the name Vol Walker Library.",

  "description": "This building, originally the Field House, was completed in 1937.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The University had long had plans for a permanent, substantial gymnasium for both intercollegiate and student recreational use. In 1905, when requests were made ot the Arkansas General assembly for funding several buildings, a gymnasium was among them, but it was removed from the list. In 1911-13, Football Coach Hugo Bezdek led a fundraising campaign to raise private money for a new gymnasium, but the effort proved unsuccessful. A similar campaign in 1923 was successful and a temporary frame gymnasium was erected. Although crowded, uncomfortable, drafty, and cold, the new gymnasium was the home of several Southwest Conference championship Razorback basketball teams. Constructed about where the Fine Arts Building is now located, the gym was dubbed \"Schmidt\u0026amp;rsquo;s Barn\" in honor of Coach Francis Schmidt, who introduced basketball to the University.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;In 1935, the Board of Trustees made plans for a new field house. A new $307,000 loan from the Public Works Administration (PWA) was approved for the field house, a men\u0026amp;rsquo;s dormitory, and additional steel stands for the football field. The successful bidder on the field house, at $128,999, was J.H. Leveck \u0026amp;amp; Son of Little Rock.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;Architects were Haralson and Nelson of Fort Smith. The building was designed in Plain Traditional style with Collegiate Gothic influences that followed the campus plan of Jamieson and Spearl of St. Louis a decade earlier. Unlike the other campus buildings of this period that were faced entirely with limestone, the new fieldhouse was primarily light buff brick, trimmed in limestone.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The Field House was completed before the fall semester 1937 and was dedicated on February 4, 1938, at a game with Texas Christian University. It was made to seat 3,500 spectators on folding bleachers. The floor could be utilized for all kinds of indoor recreational activity. The playing floor could seat an additional 4,000 in folding chairs when the area was used as an auditorium for concerts and commencements. It also was used for student registration. Athletic offices were housed in the building in addition to offices, classrooms, and laboratory space for the department of physical education.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;When Barnhill Arena was built in 1954, the basketball team and the athletic department moved out and the physical education department took over the entire building. Since a Women\u0026amp;rsquo;s Gym had been built in 1924, the Field House was renamed the Men\u0026amp;rsquo;s Gymnasium.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;In 1984, the Health, Physical Education and Recreation Building was completed, and the Men\u0026amp;rsquo;s Gymnasium was given over to the University Museum. After some alterations to the gym, the museum moved from Hotz Hall, where exhibit space had been sorely limited, in September 1986.\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br /\u0026gt;The building was officially renamed the University Museum and added to the National Register of Historic Places in September 1992 under the name of Men\u0026amp;rsquo;s Gymnaisum.",
